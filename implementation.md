## Recent Updates & Bug Fixes

### User Details Display Fix (September 6, 2025)

**Issue**: User details (username and email) were not showing properly in the workspace, particularly in the Users management pane where users appeared as "User" with no email.

**Root Cause**:

- Scattered user authentication logic across multiple components
- Inconsistent user data access patterns
- Missing user information in participants API responses
- Current user not always included in room participants list

**Solution Implemented**:

#### 1. **Centralized User Context System**

- Created `UserContext.tsx` with normalized user profile structure
- Implemented `useUser.ts` hook for consistent user data access
- Wrapped application with `UserProvider` for global user state
- Normalized user data: `{ id, email, name, avatar, initials }`

#### 2. **Enhanced UsersPane Logic**

- Added logic to ensure current user is always included in participants list
- Enhanced user information population from UserContext
- Improved name display logic for current user vs other participants
- Fixed missing email display issues
- Enhanced admin role detection and display

#### 3. **Component Updates**

- Updated all components to use centralized `useUser` hook
- Removed scattered `useAuth` implementations
- Improved user profile data consistency across the application
- Fixed dependency issues in useCallback hooks

**Files Modified**:

- `src/contexts/UserContext.tsx` (new)
- `src/hooks/useUser.ts` (new)
- `src/App.tsx` - Added UserProvider wrapper
- `src/components/workspace/panels/UsersPane.tsx` - Enhanced user display logic
- `src/components/workspace/PresenceAvatars.tsx` - Updated to use UserContext
- `src/pages/workspace/WorkspacePage.tsx` - Updated user context integration
- `src/components/profile-header.tsx` - Updated to use normalized user profile

**Result**: Users now see proper names and email addresses in all workspace components, with correct admin role display and consistent user information throughout the application.

### Tab Switch Validation Issue Fix (September 6, 2025)

**Issue**: Every time user switches to another tab and comes back to the editor, the workspace shows "Validating room access..." loading screen, even without page reload.

**Root Cause**:

- Room access validation useEffect was re-running on every component render/re-focus
- No caching mechanism for room access validation results
- Component state was being reset unnecessarily on tab switches

**Solution Implemented**:

#### 1. **Room Access Caching System**

- Added `roomAccessCache` state to store validation results
- Implemented 10-minute cache timeout for room access validation
- Cache stores room ID, user ID, access status, and validation timestamp

#### 2. **Smart Cache Validation**

- Check cache before making API calls for room access validation
- Only re-validate when cache is expired or missing
- Cache both successful and failed validation attempts

#### 3. **Cache Invalidation Logic**

- Clear cache when navigating to different rooms
- Maintain cache during tab switches for same room
- Proper cache key management using room identifier and user ID

**Files Modified**:

- `src/pages/workspace/WorkspacePage.tsx` - Added room access caching logic

**Result**: Users can now switch tabs without triggering unnecessary room access validation, providing smoother user experience while maintaining security.
